  ```

3. Copy & run migrations

  ```

4. Restart your server

  If your server was running, restart it so that it can find the assets properly.

## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_customer_segmentation/factories'
```
